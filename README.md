## Disclaimer: Work In Progress! ⚠

Hey! This project is currently **under active development.**  
Please take a look at the vision below, and feel free to [contribute](#contributing) to help bring it to life! 💜

⭐ Feel free to **star the project**, it motivates a lot :)

## About
⚡ **Nuro** is a **3D game engine** written in C++ designed for **rapid iteration** and a **seamless development** workflow. It’s supposed to help developers focus on what matters most, with minimal setup and **no interruptions**.

🚀 It's an **intuitive and easy-to-understand** tool for **rapid game prototyping** and quickly building small games, perfect for game jams. Its **synchronous architecture** ensures **zero delays** between developing and testing your game!

❌ It's is ***not*** another high-performance AAA-Engine, there's plenty of awesome options for that! Instead the goal is to deliver a smooth, efficient, and intuitive development experience tailored for smaller projects.

This project is still in an early state and **not ready to use yet**, however please feel encouraged to **help realize the vision** by [contributing](#contributing). To get an overview of the current state of the project, **check out the [showcase](#showcase)**. 📷
